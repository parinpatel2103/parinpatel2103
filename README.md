## Hi there!

My name is Parin, and I'm a UT Austin electrical and computer engineering student interested in all things AI & Data Science.

I enjoy working on projects where theory meets the real world

Right now, I’m most excited about the two projects pinned below:

---

### AI-Native 5G Digital Twin
- **Repo:** [ai-native-5G-digital-twin](https://github.com/parinpatel2103/ai-native-5G-digital-twin)  
- Senior design project comparing AI-based receivers with classical signal processing techniques in 5G systems. Uses ray-traced digital twins and realistic channel modeling to study coverage, interference, and receiver performance in complex environments.

### Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Classification
- **Repo:** [chest-xray-multilabel-classification](https://github.com/parinpatel2103/chest-xray-multilabel-classification)  
- Deep learning project for detecting multiple thoracic conditions from chest X-ray images using transfer learning. Focuses on real-world ML workflows including dataset filtering, threshold tuning, evaluation metrics, and model interpretability with Grad-CAM..

### Why I enjoy this kind of work
I like projects where I can:
- break down large problems into something testable  
- learn by building and debugging  
- understand *why* a model behaves the way it does
