## Hi there! 👋

My name is Parin, and I'm a UT Austin electrical and computer engineering student interested in all things AI & Data Science.

I enjoy working on projects where theory meets the real world.

Right now, I’m most excited about the two projects pinned below:

---

### AI-Native 5G Digital Twin
- **Repo:** [ai-native-5G-digital-twin](https://github.com/parinpatel2103/ai-native-5G-digital-twin)  
- AI-Native vs classical 5G receiver evaluation using a ray-traced digital twin.

### Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Classification
- **Repo:** [chest-xray-multilabel-classification](https://github.com/parinpatel2103/chestxray-multilabel)
- Multi-label chest X-ray classification with transfer learning and model interpretability.

### Why I enjoy this kind of work
I like projects where I can:
- break down large problems into something testable  
- learn by building and debugging  
- understand *why* a model behaves the way it does
